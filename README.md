### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sandino. I'm currently a student of Information Technology at UFRN/IMD. My main focus is back-end development using Java and Spring, but I'm also good in back-end development using Javascript. I love studying about various things, but nowadays, I mainly focus on studying about software architecture and distributed systems.
